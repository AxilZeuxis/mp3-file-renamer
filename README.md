# MP3 File Renamer

This project automates the process of renaming MP3 files based on their content. The tool extracts the original names of the files from a specified folder, processes these names using ChatGPT for corrections and improvements, and then renames the MP3 files with the updated names.

## Features:
- Extracts MP3 file names from a folder.
- Uses ChatGPT to correct and update the names.
- Renames the files according to the updated names.
- Simple and easy-to-use scripts for batch renaming files.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Python packages: `os`, `openai` (for ChatGPT integration).
